# FSW COding Standards

## Introduction
This document outlines the coding standards for the FSW codebase.

## Naming Conventions

### Classes
- All classes must be prefixed with `C` (e.g., `CGyroscope`)
- Class names should use CamelCase

### Namespaces
- All namespaces must be prefixed with `N` (e.g., `NRtos`)
- Namespace names should use CamelCase

### Functions
- Public functions should be capitalized CamelCase (e.g., `GetValue()`)
- Private functions should be lowercase camelCase (e.g., `calculateValue()`)
- Function names should be descriptive and reflect what the function does

### Variables
- Member variables should use camelCase
- Local variables should use camelCase
- Constants should use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES

## Formatting Guidelines

### Indentation and Spacing
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs). Most editors should be configured to convert tabs to spaces automatically.
- Maximum line length should be 120 characters
- Use spaces between keywords and parentheses (e.g., `if (condition)`, `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)`)
- No spaces inside parentheses (e.g., `if (condition)` not `if ( condition )`)

### Braces
- Opening braces should be on the same line as the statement (e.g., `if (condition) {`)
- Closing braces should be on their own line, aligned with the opening statement

### Whitespace
- One blank line between function definitions
- One blank line between logical groups of code within functions
- All files should end with a newline

### Pointers and References
- The `*` and `&` symbols should be placed next to the type, not the variable name
  - Correct: `int* ptr;`
  - Incorrect: `int *ptr;`

## Comments
- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments
- Each file should have a header comment describing its purpose
- Complex algorithms should be accompanied by comments explaining the logic

## File Organization
- Headers should use include guards
- Include statements should be grouped and ordered by library (standard, third-party, project)
- Forward declarations should be used where appropriate to minimize includes

## Error Handling
- Functions that can fail should return error codes or use exceptions as appropriate
- All error conditions should be checked and handled appropriately

## Enforcement
These standards are enforced using clang-format and custom scripts in the CI pipeline.
