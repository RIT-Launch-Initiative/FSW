description: Barometer that takes its inputs from an openrocket simulation CSV

compatible: "openrocket,barometer"

include: [openrocket-sensor-device.yaml]

properties:
  temp-noise:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Magnitude of noise measured by this sensor * 1,000.
      As this is temperature (measured in celsius), that would be millicelsius.
      Device tree does not seem to support floating point values.
      Randomness is added by generating a number from -1 to 1 then multiplying by this value/1000 before adding on to the baseline value
  pressure-noise:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Magnitude of noise measured by this sensor * 1,000.
      As this is pressure (measured in kPa), that would be pascals.
      Device tree does not seem to support floating point values.
      Randomness is added by generating a number from -1 to 1 then multiplying by this value/1000 before adding on to the baseline value
