description: IMU that takes its inputs from an openrocket simulation CSV

compatible: "openrocket,imu"

include: [openrocket-sensor-device.yaml]

properties:
  vertical-axis:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is up (the direction the rocket goes)
      Options:
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_X
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z
    enum:
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_X"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z"
      
  vertical-axis-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, invert the vertical axis (multiply by -1). 
      This is helpful if your actual IMU is upside down

  lateral-axis:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is sideways
      Options:
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_X
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z
    enum:
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_X"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z"

  roll-axis:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is roll
      Options:
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_X
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z
    enum:
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_X"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z"
  pitch-axis:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is pitch
      Options:
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_X
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z
    enum:
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_X"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z"
  yaw-axis:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |
      Which axis is yaw
      Options:
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_X
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y
      - OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z
    enum:
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_X"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Y"
      - "OPENROCKET_AXIS_Z"
  roll-axis-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, invert the roll axis (multiply by -1). 
  pitch-axis-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, invert the roll axis (multiply by -1). 
  yaw-axis-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set, invert the roll axis (multiply by -1). 

  accel-noise:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Magnitude of noise added to each axis of accelerometer readings * 1000 
      As device tree does not support floating point numbers, this value is in mm/s^2
      Randomness is added by generating a number from -1 to 1 then multiplying by this value/1000 before adding on to the baseline value for each component
  gyro-noise:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Magnitude of noise added to each axis of gyro readings * 1000 
      As device tree does not support floating point numbers, this value is in milliradians/s
      Randomness is added by generating a number from -1 to 1 then multiplying by this value/1000 before adding on to the baseline value for each component
