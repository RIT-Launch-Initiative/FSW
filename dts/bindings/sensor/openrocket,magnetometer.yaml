description: Magnetometer that takes its inputs from an openrocket simulation CSV

compatible: "openrocket,magnetometer"

    description: |
      Magnitude of noise measured by this sensor * 1,000.
      As this is a magnetometer (measured in gauss), that would be milligaus.
      Device tree does not seem to support floating point values.
      Randomness is added by generating a number from -1 to 1 then multiplying by this value/1000 before adding on to the baseline value
