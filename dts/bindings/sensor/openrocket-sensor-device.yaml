properties:
  lag-time-us:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Lag after the ground truth that this sensor measures.
      Some devices (like a barometer) don't update super fast. 
      Use this parameter to control that.
  sampling-period-us:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      What frequency does the sensor update at. The simulated sensor will 
      only update at this rate no matter how the underlying data changes 
      beneath it or how often the use calls `sensor_channel_fetch`.
      A value of 0 (the default) signifies the the value will interpolated 
      to read as fast as `sensor_channel_fetch` is called.
  measurement-us:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      How long does it take to measure this sensor in microseconds. 
      A call to sensor_sample_fetch on an openrocket sensor will take this long (+ a couple clock cycles) to complete
  broken:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Sometimes, your sensors are broken. Use this to mimic that. If set,
      device_is_ready will return false and sensor fetchers will return
      -ENODEV and not do anything.
