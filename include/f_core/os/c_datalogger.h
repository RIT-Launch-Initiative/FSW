 * @brief A type-safe class that supports writing fixed-sized packets to the filesystem
 * The Datalogger can be configured to use different modes:
 * - Growing - the file will grow ever larger as you write more packets (assuming space is still available on the device) 
 * - Circular - the file will hold only a certain number of packets. Old data will be overwritten with new data
 * - FixedSize - the file will hold only a certain number of packets. Old data will be retained if you try to write more packets than it can fit
 * This class is implemented as a type safe wrapper to detail::datalogger.
